# 🎨 CSS Advanced Project

Welcome to the **CSS Advanced** project — a deep dive into real-world web styling! This project demonstrates my ability to translate high-fidelity designs from Figma into a pixel-perfect, responsive, and accessible webpage using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and a sprinkle of creativity. 🚀

## 📚 Project Overview

This project is part of the **ALX Software Engineering Program** and focuses on applying advanced CSS techniques to style a prebuilt HTML structure based on a Figma design. The result is a fully styled webpage that closely mirrors the designer's vision.
